# Solmere
Solmere is a systems-driven RPG where kingdoms rise, wars unfold, and the world evolves â€” with or without the player. Featuring procedurally generated maps, a layered combat system focused on stamina, skill, and timing rather than hit points, and a component-based architecture designed for emergent gameplay.
